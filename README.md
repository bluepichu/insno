# Ito

Ito is a touch-gesture-building library for JS.  Rather than provide a set of predefined gestures for you to hook into, Ito aims to give you the tools to build your own interesting and unique gestures for your application.

Documentation is coming soon.  In the meantime, check out `test/index.html` for a usage example.
